        <h2>02. A Little More About Me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Hi, my name is Thinh. I enjoy making things, whether digitally or with my own hands. I've been working as a leatherworker for the past 5 years. Although the career is rewarding, it's time for a fresh start and a new challenge to continue growing as a person. </p>
            <p>My first foray into web development started back in 2019 when I was putting together <a href="https://bbqinprogress.com" target="_blank">my BBQ blog</a> using the page builder Elementor. It took me a while to cobble up a working website, but those hard hours taught me a great deal about HTML & CSS.</p>
            <p>Fast-forward to the end of 2021, I decided to go all in and teach myself how to code, starting with <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> and now <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">theOdinProject</a>. I've failed, succeeded and, most importantly, learned a lot so far. I still have a long way to go but I'm truly excited for what the future holds.</p>
            <p>These are the skills and technologies I've been constantly improving on:</p>

        <h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
        <p>üëãüèº Hi, my name is Thinh. I enjoy making things, whether digitally or with my own hands. I've been working as a leatherworker for the past 5 years. Although the career is rewarding, it's time for a fresh start and a new challenge to continue growing as a person. </p>
        <p>My first foray into web development started back in 2019 when I was putting together my BBQ blog using the page builder Elementor. It took me a while to cobble up a working website, but those hard hours taught me a great deal about HTML & CSS.</p>
        <p>Fast-forward to the end of 2021, I decided to go all in and teach myself how to code, starting with freeCodeCamp and now theOdinProject. I've failed, succeeded and, most importantly, learned a lot so far. I still have a long way to go but I'm truly excited for what the future holds.</p>
        <p>These are the skills and technologies I've been constantly improving on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Problem solving</li>
            <li>Debugging</li>
            <li>Googling</li>
            <li>Technical writing</li>
            <li>Version control - Git </li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>

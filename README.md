Welcome to my professional portfolio website hosted by Github Pages. Here, you'll find my featured projects, with links to their respective Github and Live Preview. This is the first iteration of the site, but I'll be updating it as I progress with my education. Please have a look around and feel free to reach out if anything catches your attention.

## Here are the list of the featured projects:
- [x] **Calculator**
![project_1](https://github.com/teephan91/teephan91.github.io/blob/f4d236e62ea883c46555c8500b266d58d323f1dc/img/project_1.png)
This is an on-screen calculator, with four basic math operators plus a decimal point button. Users can turn on/off the calculator as they wish. They provide the input by clicking on the buttons or from their favorite keyboard.

- [x] **Proofhub sign-up form**
![project_2](https://github.com/teephan91/teephan91.github.io/blob/f4d236e62ea883c46555c8500b266d58d323f1dc/img/project_2.png)
This is my attempt to recreate ProofHub's sign-up form from scratch. This sign-up form is mobile-friendly. And the form validation is done via Vanilla Javascript.

- [x] **Etch-a-sketch**
![project_3](https://github.com/teephan91/teephan91.github.io/blob/f4d236e62ea883c46555c8500b266d58d323f1dc/img/project_3.png)
This is an online Etch-A-Sketch. Users can draw on the sketchpad using the mouse. They can change the size of the pad and the color of the "brush". There is also a button to clear all the sketching if users want to start over.

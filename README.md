Welcome to my professional portfolio website hosted by Github Pages. Here, you'll find my featured projects, with links to their respective Github and Live Preview. This is the *first iteration* of the site, but I'll be updating it as I progress with my education. Please have a look around and feel free to reach out if anything catches your attention.

## Here are the list of the featured projects:
### Calculator

<div align="center">

</div>

This is an on-screen calculator, with four basic math operators plus a decimal point button. Users can turn on/off the calculator as they wish. They provide the input by clicking on the buttons or from their favorite keyboard.<br>

</div>

This is my attempt to recreate ProofHub's sign-up form from scratch. This sign-up form is mobile-friendly. And the form validation is done via Vanilla Javascript.<br>

This is an online Etch-A-Sketch. Users can draw on the sketchpad using the mouse. They can change the size of the pad and the color of the "brush". There is also a button to clear all the sketching if users want to start over.<br>

## Installation & Set Up
1. You have to fork this repo first. Github has a their own [step-by-step guide with pictures to follow along](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
- **Note**: You have the option of changing the name of your forked repo.
2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/teephan91.github.io.git
```
- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'teephan91.github.io.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.
3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.
```
cd teephan91.github.io
